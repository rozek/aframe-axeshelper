**NPM users**: please consider the [Github README](https://github.com/rozek/aframe-axeshelper/blob/main/README.md) for the latest description of this package (as updating the docs would otherwise always require a new NPM package version)

## Installation ##

`aframe-axeshelper` may be used as an ECMAScript module (ESM) or explicitly loaded after the `<script>` tag for A-Frame itself.

For the ESM variant, install the package into your build environment using [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/) with the command

```
npm install aframe-axeshelper
```

and `import` it in your code whereever needed

```javascript
import "aframe-axeshelper"
```

Otherwise, load the plain script file directly

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/aframe-axeshelper"></script>
```
